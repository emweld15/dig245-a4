<h3>Project Overview:</h3>
The intent of this project was for our group to choose a website and test its usability.  We created 5 tasks of which our tester (Nyjay) was asked to find on the website.  We tracked the amount of time it took him to find all the information as well as how he felt during and after finding the information.

  <span>Results:</span>
</h3>
<p>Nyjay's conclusions lead us to believe that the Davidson College website is relatively easy to use.  Some informaiton requires users to dig a little deeper, but overall, this page is easily navigable for those who have prior knowledge of technology use.</p>

<h3>What are the school's guidelines surrounding COVID-19?</h3>
Nyjay began with scrolling around the main page, but there was no information on the homepage. Ebola came up before coronavirus when he searched the keyword, “precautions”. He then resumed scrolling and couldn’t find anything. He then changed his keyword search to "coronavirus" and the only information that showed up for that keyword was related researc. Nyjay then looked on news and event and still couldn’t find anything. He fianlly went to “fall semester and updates,” then found it under “health and safety” on the toolbar.

    <h3>Where can the available course list be found?</h3>
    Nyjay first went to menu, then to academics, and then he had to scroll for a bit. He ended up finding the course catalog at the bottom of the screen which he then clicked on. Nyjay found the course list in the sidebar.

        He first scrolled to the bottom quickly to find the academic calendars. Nyjay then scrolled to the bottom and found the corresponding documents.

      <h3>Who is the head of the chemistry department?</h3>
      Nyjay first looked up chemistry department in the toolbar, then went found faculty & staff for the chemistry department. He had to scroll through for a moment because the head of the department was not listed at the top, but instead was listed somewhere in the middle of the section.

           Nyjay first went to the menu, then to housing & dining which led him to having to scroll to college dining services, found meal plans in the sidebar, then found the option to choose the meal plan at bottom. (**Having found the course list previously made it easier for him to predict where the academic calendar and departments would be, so he had relatively faster times finding that information.**)
